# yo-react-struggle
Light react app generator, perfect for github, amazon, or any other cdn!

This generator uses jsx, scss, and react-router. It is generally a personable convience, but it is available for everyone.

## Installation

First, install [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io) and generator-react-struggle using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (we assume you have pre-installed [node.js](https://nodejs.org/)).

```bash
npm install -g yo
npm install -g generator-react-struggle
```

Ready yourself for react struggle

```bash
yo react-struggle
```

React struggle will create a folder for you project, navigate there, do a

```bash
npm run watch
```

and your off!

## Project structure

Once you've scaffold the app you'll have something like this:


```
/src
 -> app.js
//components
   -> root.jsx
//stylesheets
   -> main.scss
```

App js has the router information in it, root.jsx is where you should begin your app,
and main.scss is where you should begin your styling.
